# Hive.js Documentation
Hello stranger! This book gives guidance to new users of Hive.js (this is on the to-do list), helps you with the setup of your own instance, shows you how to integrate it with your own app and familiarizes you with its internals.

## Meta
This book is a git repository [hosted on github](https://github.com/hivejs/docs). This means that anyone, including you, can edit it and submit the changes! It may, however, be more pleasant to read this book in a compiled form: either as a website at [docs.hivejs.org](http://docs.hivejs.org), or as an E-Book in ([PDF](https://www.gitbook.com/download/pdf/book/hivejs/hive-js-documentation), [ePUB](https://www.gitbook.com/download/epub/book/hivejs/hive-js-documentation) or [Mobi](https://www.gitbook.com/download/mobi/book/hivejs/hive-js-documentation)).

This documentation covers version 0.8 of hive.js. For earlier versions see the [branches on the github repository](https://github.com/hivejs/docs/branches).

Also, checkout the [table of contents](SUMMARY.md), if you don't see it on the left.
